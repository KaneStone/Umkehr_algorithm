# Dobson Umkehr code things to fix before it can be published

## Not in order - update each when fixed.
14. Include option to retrieve entire month as one retrieval vector
15. naming convention script needs to be updated <span style="color:red">DONE (but maybe not needed)</span>
16. Need to make sure that read Umkehr accounts for all year range input possibilities <span style="color:red">DONE</span>
17. properly define output covariance error matrices in Optimal Estimation script
18. Need to make sure that changing altitude and layer width does not crash anything <span style="color:red">DONE</span>
19. May need to look at g (in Nvaluezs) for Mie scattering. <span style="color:red">DONE</span>
20. Need to fix covariance error output.
21. Fix AK
22. Need to make sure plot retrieval is working properly for all versions on matlab
23. Decide whether or not to create a common plotting function for print diagnostics.
24. Maybe I can also combine plot retrieval and print diagnostics
25. Need to go through all user inputs to make sure they are working properly.
26. Then put it on Github
27. Send to colleagues 
27. Write the paper
28. I need to code in the band passes and solar flux at the top of the atmosphere constants as I do not believe they are removed through  my normalisation process.

Information content - 3D reduction in the error covariance volumes - how
% much information from measurements versus a priori
